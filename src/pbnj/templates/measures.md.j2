# üìä Measures

This document contains all DAX measures and their formulas from the Power BI data model.

## Measures Summary

| Measure | Table | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
{% for measure in measures -%}
| {{ measure.name | default("Unknown") }} | {{ measure.table | default("Unknown") }} | {{ measure.description | truncate(50) | default("No description") }} |
{% endfor %}

## Detailed Measure Definitions

{% for measure in measures %}
### {{ measure.name | default("Unknown Measure") }}

{% if measure.description %}
**Description**: {{ measure.description }}
{% endif %}

**Properties:**
- **Table**: {{ measure.table | default("Unknown") }}
- **Data Type**: {{ measure.data_type | default("Unknown") }}
- **Format**: {{ measure.format | default("Auto") }}

#### DAX Formula
```dax
{{ measure.expression | default("Formula not available") }}
```

{% if measure.dependencies %}
#### Dependencies
This measure depends on:
{% for dep in measure.dependencies -%}
- {{ dep }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if measure.used_by %}
#### Used By
This measure is used by:
{% for usage in measure.used_by -%}
- {{ usage }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if not loop.last %}
---
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## üéØ Measure Categories

### Key Performance Indicators
{% for measure in measures -%}
{% if "KPI" in measure.name or "Total" in measure.name or "Sum" in measure.name or "Count" in measure.name -%}
- **{{ measure.name }}**: {{ measure.description | default("Performance metric") }}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

### Calculated Ratios
{% for measure in measures -%}
{% if "Ratio" in measure.name or "Rate" in measure.name or "Percent" in measure.name or "%" in measure.name -%}
- **{{ measure.name }}**: {{ measure.description | default("Calculated ratio") }}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

## üìà DAX Patterns Analysis

### Common Functions Used
{% set all_formulas = measures | map(attribute="expression") | join(" ") | upper %}
{% if "SUM(" in all_formulas %}
- **SUM()**: Used for aggregating numerical values
{% endif %}
{% if "CALCULATE(" in all_formulas %}
- **CALCULATE()**: Used for filtered calculations
{% endif %}
{% if "SUMX(" in all_formulas %}
- **SUMX()**: Used for row-by-row calculations
{% endif %}
{% if "FILTER(" in all_formulas %}
- **FILTER()**: Used for applying filters
{% endif %}
{% if "RELATED(" in all_formulas %}
- **RELATED()**: Used for accessing related table data
{% endif %}

### Complexity Assessment
{% set complex_count = 0 %}
{% for measure in measures -%}
{% if measure.expression and ("CALCULATE" in measure.expression or "SUMX" in measure.expression or "FILTER" in measure.expression) -%}
{% set complex_count = complex_count + 1 %}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

- **Simple Measures**: {{ measures | length - complex_count }} (basic aggregations)  
- **Complex Measures**: {{ complex_count }} (advanced DAX)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è No Measures Found

This Power BI file doesn't appear to contain any custom DAX measures, or they couldn't be extracted. This might indicate:

- The file primarily uses implicit measures (auto-generated)
- Measures are defined in calculated columns instead
- The extraction process needs refinement for this specific file

{% endif %}

## üí° Best Practices

### For DAX Development
- Use CALCULATE() for most filtered aggregations
- Consider performance implications of complex measures
- Document business logic in measure descriptions
- Use meaningful measure names that reflect business terminology

### For Business Users
- Measures represent the calculated metrics in your reports
- Each measure follows a specific business rule encoded in DAX
- Measure names should be intuitive for report consumers
