# üîó Relationships

This document describes the data model relationships that connect tables in the Power BI semantic model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è No Relationships Found

This Power BI file doesn't appear to contain explicit relationships, which might indicate:

- Single table model (all data in one table)
- Relationships defined through DAX instead of model relationships
- Extraction process needs refinement for this specific file
- File contains disconnected tables

**Recommendations:**
- Review if table relationships should be established
- Consider normalizing data if everything is in one large table
- Check for implicit relationships that could be made explicit

## üí° Best Practices

### For Data Modelers
- Prefer star schema design with clear fact and dimension tables
- Use one-to-many relationships where possible
- Minimize many-to-many relationships
- Consider performance impact of bidirectional filtering
- Keep inactive relationships only when necessary for alternative relationship paths

### For Report Developers
- Understand how relationships affect filter context in DAX
- Be aware of active vs inactive relationships when writing measures
- Consider relationship direction when designing visuals
- Test filtering behavior across related tables

### For Business Users
- Relationships determine how data filtering works across visuals
- Connected tables allow for interactive filtering in reports
- Relationship quality directly impacts report accuracy and performance
