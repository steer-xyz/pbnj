# üìä Measures

This document contains all DAX measures and their formulas from the Power BI data model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è No Measures Found

This Power BI file doesn't appear to contain any custom DAX measures, or they couldn't be extracted. This might indicate:

- The file primarily uses implicit measures (auto-generated)
- Measures are defined in calculated columns instead
- The extraction process needs refinement for this specific file


## üí° Best Practices

### For DAX Development
- Use CALCULATE() for most filtered aggregations
- Consider performance implications of complex measures
- Document business logic in measure descriptions
- Use meaningful measure names that reflect business terminology

### For Business Users
- Measures represent the calculated metrics in your reports
- Each measure follows a specific business rule encoded in DAX
- Measure names should be intuitive for report consumers
